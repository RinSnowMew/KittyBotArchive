# KittyBot
Discord bot using the JDA 3.4.0 framework. This project is both a functioning
bot, and a place for us to experiment with bot features! The `master` branch
is more stable, whereas `develop` has more features. 

Features:
- Tracks how many things you've said!
- Runs polls and votes!
- Can roll dice for you!
- Watches you while you RP and writes it down!
- Searches Wolfram Alpha on your behalf!
- Goes and compiles your c++!
- Searches e621 and Derpibooru on your behalf! (coming soon!)
