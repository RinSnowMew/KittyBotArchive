New setup:
--

Using Eclipse, this folder should show up in the project by default. You can right-click on the .jar files and select BuildPath > Add to Build Path, and that's it!


General setup:
--

Setting up the project requries that you first have a java IDE of your choice installed. It's recommended you get something that can automatically handle dependency addition for you, as this will speed up the setup process.

Rough setup guide:
- Make sure you have downloaded and installed [JDK 8.xxx](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- Clone the repo and create a new project in your Java IDE of choice. Note that all bot files fall under the dv8tion package for ease of use. `package main.java.net.dv8tion`.
- Note that `Ref.java` is not included in this repo on account of key privacy. If you're creating your own fork, you'll want to get your own ket, etc. For this repo, contact another repo dev to see if you can be granted access to it.
- Once you have created the project and placed the source files in the appropriate package, add the .jar files located in here as project dependencies.
